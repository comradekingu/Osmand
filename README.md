OsmAnd is actively developed open source. Everyone can contribute to the app by reporting bugs, [improving translations](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/osmand/), or coding new features. The project enjoys continuous improvement by all these forms of developer and user interaction. Progress also relies on [donations](https://osmand.net/help-online#buy_app) for development, coding, OSM cartography, and testing of new functionality. By buying OsmAnd+ and subscribing to OsmAnd Live you help the app!
